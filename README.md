# Framework laptop

The following is a list of items I need to build my preferred laptop upgrade. All of these can be purchased officially from [frame.work](https://frame.work) and not all items need to be purchased at once. Framework laptops are modular, so it is possible to buy the components in small pieces rather than as a whole unit, which would total to about $2700.
